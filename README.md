# Data_Visualization_of_Relation_Between_GDP_RenewableEnergy_SJR_Ranking
Here I have written a code using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib to visualize the data and setting up a relation between GDP, %Renewable Energy and SJR Ranking. This is a bubble chart showing % Renewable vs. Rank. The size of the bubble corresponds to the countries'  2014 GDP, and the color corresponds to the continent.
